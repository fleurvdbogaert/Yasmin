# KHFAC_processing2
Intrduction
Completely altered the flow of processing data from the pipeline that was made by students before. 
Stimulation and pressure are evaluated individually using a CNN and moving standard deviation respectively. 
After this calculations can be applied to the data. 
This code is more generalised and variables are less co-dependent compared to the previous algorithm and therefore applicable to a larger variety of data.
