# KHFAC_processing2

Completely altered the flow of processing data from the pipeline that was made by students before and can be found in KHFAC_processing.
Stimulation and pressure channels measured within rats are evaluated individually using a CNN and moving standard deviation respectively. 
After this calculations are applied to te resulting data.
This code is more generalised and variables are less co-dependent compared to the previous algorithm and therefore applicable to a larger variety of data.
